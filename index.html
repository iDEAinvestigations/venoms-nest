  The fix is simple - we just need to update the index.html on GitHub. The file on your computer has the correct links, but GitHub still has the old ones.

  On your Mac:

  1. Open Safari/Chrome
  2. Go to: github.com/IDEAInvestigations/venoms-nest
  3. Click index.html
  4. Click the pencil icon ✏️ to edit
  5. Cmd+A → Delete → Cmd+V (the correct code is on your clipboard)
  6. Click Commit changes
